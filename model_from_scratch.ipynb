    "1. NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER.\n",
    "• Transgression of the Law.\n",
    "Finance Minister Fouquet unintentionally outshone his master, King Louis XIV, making\n",
    "the King feel insecure by throwing a lavish party that would show off Fouquet’s\n",
    "connections, cultivated manner and charm. Thinking this move would make him an\n",
    "indispensable asset to the king, Fouquet had actually offended his master who did not\n",
    "like the fact people were more charmed by his finance minister than by him. The King\n",
    "found a convenient excuse to get rid of Fouquet.\n",
    "• Observance of the Law\n",
    "Galileo was clever in observing this law by giving glory to his patrons. In order to solve\n",
    "his perennial problem of funding, he dedicated his discovery of the moons of Jupiter to\n",
    "the Medicis, since the royal symbol of the Medici family was the planet Jupiter. He then\n",
    "commissioned an emblem for them, with each moon representing one of the sons who\n",
    "revolved around the patriarch. The Medici family became his major patron, appointing\n",
    "him their official court mathematician and philosopher, thereby giving him a more\n",
    "comfortable life and a steady salary.\n",

    "• Never take your position for granted.\n",
    "• Never let favors you receive go to your head.\n",

    "ENEMIES.\n",
    "• Transgression of the Law.\n",
    "Michael III of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-ninth century A.D. placed too much\n",
    "trust in his friend, Basilius. This was a young man who had once saved his life, and in\n",
    "return, was given all the privileges an emperor could bestow on a friend. Michael\n",

    "grabbing his throne one day. He spared those who conspired against him, and was\n",
    "able to win over enemies with his generosity.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Do not rely on friends. They will never be totally honest with you. They will not\n",
    "openly disagree with you in order to avoid arguments.\n",
    "• Enemies expect nothing so they will be surprised when you are generous.\n",
    "• An enemy spared the guillotine will be more grateful to you than a friend.\n",
    "• When you decide to hire a friend you will discover qualities she has kept hidden.\n",
    "• Skill and competence are more important than friendly feelings.\n",
    "• Hiring friends will limit your power.\n",
    "• All working situations require a kind of distance between people.\n",
    "• You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him.\n",
    "• An enemy at your heels keeps you sharp, alert, and focused.\n",
    "3. CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS.\n",
    "• Transgression of the Law.\n",
    "The Marquis de Sevigne was young and inexperienced in the art of love. He confided\n",
    "in the infamous courtesan of seventeenth-century France, Ninon de Lenclos, to\n",
    "instruct him on how to seduce a difficult young countess. She made him follow a plan\n",
    "over a number of weeks, where the Marquis would be appearing in public always\n",
    "surrounded by beautiful women, in the very places the countess would be expected\n",
    "to see him. He was supposed to assume an air of nonchalance. This increased the\n",
    "jealousy of the young countess, who was not sure of his interest in her. One day the\n",
    "Marquis, unable to control his passion, broke from Ninon’s plan, and blurted out to\n",
    "the countess that he loved her. After this admission, the countess no longer found\n",
    "him interesting and avoided him.\n",
    "• Observance of the Law\n",
    "Otto von Bismarck was a deputy in the Prussian parliament at a time when many\n",
    "fellow deputies thought it was possible to go to war against Austria and defeat it.\n",
    "Bismarck knew the Prussian army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way to\n",
    "keep the war at bay. He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked about\n",
    "the madness of war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announced\n",
    "his real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have\n",
    "won. Most Prussians wanted to go to war at that moment and mistakenly believed\n",
    "their army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity would\n",
    "have been doubted. By giving misleading statements about wanting peace and\n",
    "concealing his true purpose, Bismarck’s speech catapulted him to the position of\n",
    "prime minister. He later led the country to war against the Austrians at the right time,\n",
    "when he felt the Prussian army was more capable.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off scent.\n",
    "• Use smoke screens (a poker face) to disguise your actions.\n",
    "• False sincerity is one powerful tool that will send your rivals on a wild goose\n",
    "chase.\n",
    "• Publicly declare your false intentions to give misleading signals.\n",
    "• A noble gesture can be a smoke screen to hide your true intentions.\n",

    "• Transgression of the Law.\n",
    "Coriolanus was a great military hero of ancient Rome. People held him in awe, until\n",
    "he opened his mouth. He spoke his mind, hardly able to control his arrogance and\n",
    "boastfulness. He slandered and insulted people. The more speeches he made, the\n",
    "less people respected him. He suffered the people’s wrath and was eventually\n",
    "banished from the city.\n",
    "• Observance of the Law\n",
    "Masters of enigma Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp knew the power of saying less\n",
    "and keeping people guessing. The less Duchamp talked about his work, the more it\n",
    "was talked about in the art circles. Andy Warhol recognized it was hard to talk people\n",
    "into doing what you wanted, so when interviewed, he would give vague and\n",
    "ambiguous answers and let the interviewer find his own interpretation.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Saying less will keep you from saying something foolish or even dangerous.\n",
    "• Once the words are out you cannot take them back.\n",
    "• Keeping silent makes people reveal more about themselves. This is information\n",
    "you may be able to use against them later on.\n",

    "LIFE.\n",
    "• Observance of the Law\n",
    "During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D.207-265), General Liang was able to\n",
    "fool his rival Sima Yi simply by letting his track record for being an undefeated leader\n",
    "in battle do the work for him. Liang’s troops were far outnumbered by Sima Yi’s, yet\n",
    "he devised a clever last resort plan. Liang donned a Taoist robe and played the lute\n",
    "upon the wall of the city he was defending. His soldiers opened the gates and hid.\n",
    "When Sima Yi’s troops advanced upon the unguarded city, Yi recognized his\n",
    "opponent sitting alone upon the wall. Fearing a trap, Sima Yi called his soldiers to\n",
    "retreat.\n",
    "P.T. Barnum was an expert at destroying his competitor’s reputation. He published\n",
    "letters in newspapers, warning the public against buying his opponent’s stock. He\n",
    "was a master at poking mockery at the tactics of his rivals.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Sow doubt and spread rumors about your rival. Even if they vehemently deny it,\n",
    "people will still be wondering why they are so defensive.\n",
    "• Use humor or gentle mockery at your rival’s expense.\n",
    "• A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your strengths\n",
    "without your having to spend much energy.\n",
    "• Never appear desperate in your self-defense against the slander of others.\n",
    "• Be careful not to go too far in attacking another’s reputation, it draws more\n",
    "attention to your vengefulness than to the person you are slandering. Use subtler\n",
    "tactics like satire and ridicule.\n",
    "6. COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST.\n",

    "www.bizsum.com © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com\n",
    "P.T. Barnum learned about courting attention to his favor. Any form of publicity would\n",
    "benefit his entertainment business, no matter if it were bad publicity. He promoted his\n",
    "shows of curiosities to audiences with all kinds of gimmicks. He would offer Free\n",
    "Music for Millions, but hire bad musicians, so the crowd would end up buying tickets\n",
    "to the show so they could avoid the bands. He planted articles in newspapers and\n",
    "even sent anonymous letters to keep his name in the limelight.\n",
    "Margaretha Zelle was able to use this law to make a name for herself as the\n",
    "mysterious exotic dancer Mata Hari. It was rumored she was from India and danced\n",
    "in private parties, in an Eastern manner never before seen in Europe. She would\n",
    "slowly discard her veils and sarongs for the most prominent people in Paris who\n",
    "came to see her. Many years later it would be discovered she was just a native of\n",
    "Holland and had worked for the Germans as a spy.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Surround your name with the sensational and the scandalous.\n",
    "• Create an air of mystery.\n",
    "• It is better to be attacked and slandered than ignored.\n",
    "• Make yourself appear larger than life.\n",

    "Nicola Tesla was a Serbian scientist who never learned how this law was used\n",
    "against him time and again. His invention, the AC or alternating current system was\n",
    "associated not with his name but with that of George Westinghouse, who funded his\n",
    "research. Both Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse were ruthless\n",
    "businessmen who took credit for Tesla’s work. In the end, Tesla was living in poverty,\n",
    "while royalties for his life’s work went to Edison and Westinghouse. He accepted\n",
    "small sums as buy-outs for his work, when in reality his creations could have been\n",
    "worth millions. Even Marconi made use of a patent filed by Tesla in 1897. Tesla was\n",
    "the real “father of radio” but received no money or credit for this invention.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Save time and energy by hiring others to do the work.\n",
    "• Your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered.\n",
    "• Borrow from history. Use the past and profit by others’ experience.\n",

    "Napoleon loved the adoration of the masses, and this was the perfect bait to make\n",
    "the former ruler play into the hands of his opponents. In 1814 Napoleon was\n",
    "banished to a small island called Elba near Italy. Here he was given information that\n",
    "France would embrace him again if he escaped. From Elba he was able to escape\n",
    "and march back into Paris with a small army. The people bowed to him, and soldiers\n",
    "changed sides to join him. The statesmen who had taken over his empire fled.\n",
    "Talleyrand watched as his plan unfolded. Napoleon ruled France again for a hundred\n",
    "days, but the country was bankrupt and could not sustain Napoleon’s wars any\n",
    "longer. Napoleon was recaptured at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to the barren\n",
    "island St. Helena, off the west coast of Africa. This was a much further place with no\n",
    "chance of escape, and was more to Talleyrand’s liking.The 48 Laws Of Power Page 6\n",
    "www.bizsum.com © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• For negotiations and meetings, it is wise to lure others into your territory, or a\n",
    "territory of your choice.\n",
    "• Once someone suspects you are manipulating him, it will be harder to control\n",
    "him. Making him come to you gives the illusion he is in control.\n",
    "• Most often the effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be\n",
    "frustrated by the traps you set for them.\n",
    "9. WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT.\n",
    "• Observance of the Law\n",
    "Michelangelo knew how to satisfy a patron while getting his way at the same time. Piero\n",
    "Soderini, Florence’s mayor, commissioned him to transform a ruined piece of marble into\n",
    "a statue. Soderini visited the studio one day and commented that the nose of the statue\n",
    "(that of David with a sling in his hand) was too big. Michelangelo invited the mayor to\n",
    "climb up a scaffolding, allowing him to look at the nose from a different perspective, while\n",
    "the artist chiseled a bit, pretending to correct the size of the nose. The mayor was\n",
    "convinced the nose looked much better. Michelangelo succeeded in making Soderini\n",
    "think his comment had helped improve the work.\n",
    "Wisdom in a nutshell:\n",
    "• Demonstrate, do not explicate.\n",
    "• Arguing will only offend your superior.\n",
    "• Learn to demonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectly.\n",
    "• Choose your battles carefully.\n",
    "• Don’t bother demonstrating if time and experience will eventually teach the other\n",

    "King Ludwig of Bavaria to abdicate. She left another man who later fell into a deep\n",
